# webassembly-opengl-rotating_galaxy
Extends the example in https://github.com/dudeofx/webassembly-opengl-textured_triangle
Adds a couple of tweaks to make it a little bit more interesting. Good to help explain some OpenGL ES basics

## Quick Start
Run build.sh to compile the example. This will create three files: index.data, index.js and index.wasm.
To see the example run publish all the index.* files (4 total) into a subdirectory in your webserver.
